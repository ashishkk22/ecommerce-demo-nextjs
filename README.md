## Overview

This project is an e-commerce platform I've built with Next.js and MongoDB, designed to offer a seamless shopping experience. Key features include a robust cart system and dynamic coupon management.

I've integrated `Storybook` to document and visually test components, ensuring a consistent UI. Each component is thoroughly tested with `Vitest` and `React testing Library`, guaranteeing reliability across the application. The project is built with `TypeScript` to provide strong type safety and prevent runtime errors.

The API layer is crafted using `Next.js API routes` with `MongoDB` as the database, offering efficient and scalable data management. I've implemented `NextAuth` for secure authentication, allowing for flexible user management.

Styling is managed with `Tailwind CSS`, following best practices to maintain a clean and responsive design. For data fetching, I've utilized `React Query` to ensure efficient and reactive data handling across the application.
